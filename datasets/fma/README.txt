For the FMA dataset, the following folders are:

FMA_SMALL, FMA_MEDIUM, FMA_LARGE, FMA_FULL = the original mp3 data as downloaded from the FMA website
METADATA = the original metadata for the FMA dataset

TRAIN, VALID, TEST = the folders where the data is stored for training, validation and testing. 
                    Each contains its own subfolders for audio and metadata. Identical to the above folders, but with the data split.
